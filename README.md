# DataScience
Help Data Science enthusiasts to start their journey and guide them along the way. 


Prepare the environment for Data Science and Machine Learning on your laptop according to the documents, which include:
-      《Jupyter environment establishment.pdf》to install Python via Anaconda
-      《Install Theano.pdf》to install Theano (Python package for deep learnng)
-      《Install eclipse.pdf》to install Eclipse + Pydev (Integrated development environment for Python). If you use other Python IDE, then you do not need to install eclipse.
-      << helloDataScience.py>> a simple hello Data Science program in Python.


Wrting a simple hello world program in Python is as easy as helloDataScience.py is.

On your system you can veryfiy Python interpreter availability by using the folowing two commands.

$ whereis python
Will print location where Python is located on your system. 

$ which python
Gives you teh version of Python that you have on yoru system. 

Execute a Python program.

You can execute your program in teh following ways.

1. $ python helloDataScience.py

or

2. $chmod u+x helloDataScience.py
This would make your python file / program / script executable.
Then you can just run it form the same directory.

./helloDataScience.py

Both of them will print your message, in this case: Hello Data Science!

You can also execute such a simple program from command line (in case you prefer one liner, who doesn't?)

$ python -c 'print "Hello Data Science!"'
